# Neural_Network_Addition

This project focuses on training a neural network to perform addition with a variable number of inputs using backpropagation. The neural network architecture allows flexibility in defining the number of hidden layer nodes and the number of inputs for the addition task.

Key Features:

- **Variable Input and Hidden Layer Configuration**: The neural network can be customized to accommodate any number of inputs and nodes in the hidden layer. This flexibility allows for experimentation and optimization based on the specific requirements of the addition task.
- **Backpropagation**: The training process incorporates backpropagation, a widely used technique in neural networks, to adjust the weights between the nodes. Backpropagation enables the network to learn and refine its performance over time, improving accuracy in the addition task.
- **Randomly Generated Training Data**: The neural network is trained using randomly generated data, ensuring a diverse range of input combinations. This helps the network generalize and handle various input scenarios, enhancing its ability to perform addition accurately.
- **Performance Trade-off**: It is important to note that increasing the number of inputs and nodes in the hidden layer can lead to slower training and decreased precision.
